# Biobjective_RecSys

Code Organization:

		- Knapsack_solutions contains the implementation of different algorithms proposed to solve knapsack formulation, like dynamic programming, branch and bound and FPTAS. 
		- Pareto contains the implementation of the algorithm proposed in our previous work [1]
		- [T]Mining is the mining algorithm LCM used [2]
